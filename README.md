A boilerplate for smaller websites or webbapplications using PHP.

It comes prepared for handling connection to a mysql database. Just change the connection and login settings in the config.php file.

All the source files can be found in the src folder. Theme related settings can be found in the theme folder.

The sunray boilerplate was built as a part of a php and mysql course at Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola to be used in various tasks along the course. The original Anax boilerplate can be found here: https://github.com/mosbth/Anax-base

Name
====================
The name, Sunray, comes from the radio communications "call sign" (call name, call letter) which is used by the military. The appointment title of a Commander is SUNRAY which I think is a good name for this boilerplate.
